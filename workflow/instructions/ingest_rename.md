# Ingesting and Renaming Raw Footage

This guide is intended to help you through the workflow of ingesting raw footage and logging it into our database.

## Step 1: Importing
Shoots that need to be imported are placed into the Nicholas Cage (left) side of the card bin at the MPA station. Each clear bin will contain all of the cards associated with a shoot, as well as a label with the __Shoot ID__.

Each __Shoot ID__ begins with the date of the shoot, followed by what number that shoot was that day, and the label that identifies what the shoot was for.

In this example, I'll be ingesting a shoot labeled *20180511_001_LLS_Planning*.

Based on the label, we know it happened on May 5th, 2018, which was a Friday. The _001_ tells us it was the first shoot of the day, and *LLS_Planning* labels it as a planning meeting for the Learning Lab.

Grab a clear plastic bin to begin your adventure!



1. Open the drive in Finder. Since I'm importing a Friday shoot, I'm using the Friday drive. It should look similar to this when you open up a daily drive.
