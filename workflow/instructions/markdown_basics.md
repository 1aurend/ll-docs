# MARKDOWN BASICS

## Headings
To insert a heading, just add one or more `#` characters (followed by a space) at the beginning of the line. `#` will give you an `h1`, `##` will give you an `h2`, etc. For instance, at the beginning of this section we typed `## Headings` (and go ahead and view the [raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learninglab-dev/ll-docs/master/workflow/instructions/markdown_basics.md) for this doc if you don't believe us).
