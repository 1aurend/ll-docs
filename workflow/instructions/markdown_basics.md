# MARKDOWN BASICS

## Headings
To insert a heading, just add one or more `#` characters (followed by a space) at the beginning of the line. `#` will give you an `h1`, `##` will give you an `h2`, etc. For instance, at the beginning of this section we typed
```

Go ahead and view the [raw text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learninglab-dev/ll-docs/master/workflow/instructions/markdown_basics.md) for this doc to verify if you'd like.

## Lists
To insert a list, just add an `*` or a `-` plus a space for an unordered list or a number for an ordered list.  For instance:
```
- element 1
- element two
- three
```
Will give you
- element 1
- element two
- three
And
```
1. element 1
2. element two
3. three
```
Will give you
1. element 1
2. element two
3. three  

**NOTE:** you can actually type any old number at the beginning of each ordered list line.  So
```
1. element 1
4. element two
1. three
```
Will give you
1. element 1
4. element two
1. three
